FAILING BEANS (NEED FIXES)
================================================================================

These beans are currently failing verification. The main issue is test failures
related to case statement parsing and pattern handling. The failures are in:
  tests/case_statement_tests.rs

Issues preventing verification:
  - test_case_glob_bracket
  - test_case_nested_in_if
  - test_case_pattern_with_dash
  - test_case_with_variable

Failing bean IDs:
  72  - POSIX-011: Implement colon (:) no-op builtin
  73  - POSIX-012: Implement command builtin
  74  - POSIX-013: Implement readonly builtin
  75  - POSIX-014: Implement full positional parameters
  76  - POSIX-015: Implement special variables
  77  - POSIX-016: Implement here-documents
  78  - POSIX-017: Implement while loop
  79  - POSIX-018: Implement until loop
  80  - POSIX-002: Re-enable and test return builtin
  81  - POSIX-019: Implement case statement
  82  - POSIX-020: Implement IFS field splitting
  91  - POSIX-003: Re-enable and test shift builtin
  93  - POSIX-004: Re-enable and test local builtin
  94  - POSIX-005: Re-enable and test trap builtin
  95  - POSIX-006: Re-enable and test eval builtin
  96  - POSIX-007: Re-enable and test exec builtin
  97  - POSIX-008: Re-enable and test kill builtin
  98  - POSIX-009: Implement break builtin
  143 - Remove Unused Tokio Dependency

VERIFICATION PROCESS DETAILS
================================================================================

Actions Taken:
1. Fixed unused imports in the following files:
   - src/executor/pipeline.rs: Removed unused Corrector and TerminalControl imports
   - src/executor/value/render.rs: Removed unused Style import
   - src/benchmark/mod.rs: Removed unused re-exports
   - src/compat/mod.rs: Cleaned up unused re-exports

2. Attempted to use `cargo fix` to clean up remaining warnings

3. Verified all ready beans using: bn verify <id>

Passing Criteria:
- cargo build --release completes successfully
- cargo test passes all tests
- cargo clippy passes with -D warnings (treat warnings as errors)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR REMAINING 19 FAILING BEANS
================================================================================

The primary blocker is case statement parsing issues. These tests need to be
fixed before the related beans can pass verification:

File: tests/case_statement_tests.rs
Issues:
  - Bracket patterns in case statements need proper parsing support
  - Variables in case patterns need handling
  - Pattern handling in nested contexts needs fixes
  - Dash character handling in patterns

The issue appears to be in the lexer/parser - it doesn't properly handle:
  1. Bracket glob patterns like [abc] in case statements
  2. Variables like $var in case patterns
  3. Complex patterns with special characters

Recommended Action:
- Fix the case statement parser to properly handle glob patterns
- Ensure brackets are tokenized correctly
- Test with variables in patterns
- Verify special character handling

STATISTICS
================================================================================

Beans Verified: 47 out of 192 total beans in the backlog
Success Rate: 59.6% (28 out of 47 ready beans passed)
Pass Rate: 14.6% (28 out of 192 total beans)

Code Quality Improvements Made:
- Eliminated unused imports throughout codebase
- Improved code cleanliness and compilation warnings
- Maintained full test compatibility
