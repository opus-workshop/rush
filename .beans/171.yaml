  As a script writer, I need the builtin builtin to force execution of builtins even when shadowed.

  ## Priority: P2 - MEDIUM
  Useful for avoiding function conflicts with builtins.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] `builtin cmd` runs builtin, bypassing functions
  - [ ] Error if command is not a builtin
  - [ ] Exit code from builtin
  - [ ] Works with all builtins
  - [ ] cargo test passes
  - [ ] cargo build --release succeeds
  - [ ] cargo clippy -- -D warnings passes

  ## Use Cases
  ```bash
  # Function shadows builtin
  cd() {
    echo "Changing to $1"
    builtin cd "$1"  # Call actual cd builtin
  }

  # Force builtin
  builtin echo "This is the builtin echo"

  # Error on non-builtin
  builtin git status  # Error: git is not a builtin
  ```

  ## Technical Implementation
  - Add to src/builtins/mod.rs
  - Check if command is builtin
  - Execute builtin directly
  - Error if not builtin

  ## Testing
  - Run builtins
  - Error on non-builtin
  - Shadow function test

  ## Estimated Effort: 4 hours
labels:
- builtin
- p2
- scripting
verify: cargo test --lib builtins::builtin
