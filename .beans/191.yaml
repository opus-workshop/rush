  Extend awk builtin with advanced features.

  ## Scope
  - User variables and assignment
  - Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, ^)
  - Comparison and logical operators
  - if/else, while, for control flow within awk
  - Built-in string functions: length, substr, index, split, sub, gsub, tolower, toupper
  - Built-in math functions: sin, cos, sqrt, int, log, exp
  - Associative arrays
  - getline for reading input
  - Multiple input files

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] awk '{sum += $1} END{print sum}' -> sums column
  - [ ] awk '{print length($0)}' -> line lengths
  - [ ] Associative arrays work
  - [ ] Control flow within awk programs works
  - [ ] cargo test passes

  ## Files to Modify
  - src/builtins/awk.rs (extend)
