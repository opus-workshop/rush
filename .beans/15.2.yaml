  Add comparison mode to time builtin that benchmarks Rush vs bash/zsh.

  ## What to implement
  - time --compare 'cmd' mode that runs cmd in Rush, bash, and zsh
  - Execution timing for each shell
  - Speedup factor calculation
  - Graceful fallback if bash/zsh not available

  ## Files to Modify
  - src/builtins/time.rs (add compare mode logic)
  - New: src/builtins/time_compare.rs or inline helper

  ## Example Output
  ```
  time --compare 'find . -name "*.rs"'
    Rush:     23.4ms
    bash:     45.2ms  (1.9x slower)
    zsh:      38.1ms  (1.6x slower)
  ```
acceptance: |-
  - Runs command in all 3 shells available on system
  - Shows timing for each shell
  - Calculates and displays speedup factors
  - Handles missing bash/zsh gracefully
  - Useful for demonstrating Rush performance
  - cargo test passes
