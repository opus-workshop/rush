  ## Problem

  Rush's tokenizer incorrectly treats `/` as a token separator in unquoted arguments. This causes paths like `benches/rush_benchmark.py` to be split into two separate tokens: `benches` and `/rush_benchmark.py`.

  ## Reproduction

  ```bash
  ./target/release/rush -c 'echo benches/rush_benchmark.py'
  # Output: benches /rush_benchmark.py  (incorrectly split)

  ./target/release/rush -c 'cat benches/rush_benchmark.py'
  # Error: cat: benches: Is a directory
  # Error: cat: /rush_benchmark.py: No such file or directory
  ```

  ## Expected Behavior

  Paths should be treated as single tokens:
  ```bash
  ./target/release/rush -c 'echo benches/rush_benchmark.py'
  # Expected: benches/rush_benchmark.py
  ```

  ## Workaround

  Quoting the path works:
  ```bash
  ./target/release/rush -c 'python3 "benches/rush_benchmark.py"'
  ```

  ## Impact

  This breaks basic shell usage - running commands with relative or absolute paths requires quoting, which is non-standard behavior.

  ## Location

  The bug is likely in `src/lexer/mod.rs` or `src/parser/mod.rs` where tokens are split.
