  Implement the `:` (colon) builtin that does nothing and always returns success.

  ## Context
  The colon builtin is a POSIX requirement, often used in conditionals and as a no-op placeholder.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - Create src/builtins/colon.rs OR add to mod.rs as simple function
  - Implement colon builtin that returns exit code 0
  - Register as ":" in src/builtins/mod.rs
  - Test basic usage: `:` returns 0
  - Test with arguments (should ignore them): `: foo bar baz` returns 0
  - Test in conditionals: `if :; then echo yes; fi` → yes
  - Test with redirections: `: > file.txt` creates empty file
  - Test with variable assignments: `VAR=value :` sets VAR
  - Add integration tests
  - Update help text

  ## POSIX Requirements
  - Always return exit code 0
  - Ignore all arguments
  - Can be used with redirections (useful for creating files)
  - Can be used with variable assignments
  - No output

  ## Files to Create/Modify
  - src/builtins/colon.rs (new file) OR builtin_colon in mod.rs
  - src/builtins/mod.rs (register ":" → builtin_colon)
  - tests/builtin_tests.rs (add tests)

  ## Estimated Effort
  20-30k tokens (simple implementation, comprehensive tests)
verify: cargo build --release && cargo test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings
labels:
- builtin
- critical
- posix
