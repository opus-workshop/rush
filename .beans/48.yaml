  As the rush developer, I need to use rush as my login shell for 1 week so that I can identify and fix real-world issues.

  ## Priority: P1 - HIGH
  Final verification step.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Set rush as login shell on development machine
  - [ ] Use for all daily work for 1 week
  - [ ] Document all issues encountered
  - [ ] Fix critical issues immediately
  - [ ] Create beads for nice-to-have improvements
  - [ ] No crashes during 1 week trial
  - [ ] No data loss during 1 week trial
  - [ ] Performance acceptable for daily use

  ## Testing Checklist
  - [ ] Day 1: Basic usage (cd, ls, cat, git)
  - [ ] Day 2: Complex pipelines and scripts
  - [ ] Day 3: Background jobs and job control
  - [ ] Day 4: Heavy I/O operations
  - [ ] Day 5: Integration with other tools (git, cargo, npm)
  - [ ] Day 6: Stress testing (many commands, long sessions)
  - [ ] Day 7: Final verification and documentation

  ## Rollback Plan
  Keep backup shell configured:
  ```bash
  echo $SHELL > ~/.backup_shell
  # Emergency: chsh -s /bin/zsh
  ```

  ## Issues to Watch For
  - Crashes or panics
  - Orphaned processes
  - Memory leaks
  - Slow performance
  - Terminal corruption
  - Signal handling issues
  - History corruption

  ## Estimated Effort: 5 days (1 week of use + fixes)
labels:
- p1
- real-world
- rush
- stability
- testing
verify: 'cargo build --release && cargo test && echo "echo test" | ./target/release/rush'
