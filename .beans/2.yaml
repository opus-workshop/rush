  Transform Rush into the ideal shell for AI coding agents by providing structured, parseable output and native data handling.

  ## Motivation
  AI coding agents (like Claude Code) make hundreds of shell calls per task. They currently suffer from:
  - Parsing unstructured text output (fragile, slow)
  - Spawning jq/external tools for JSON (overhead)
  - Insufficient error context (can't respond intelligently)
  - Performance bottlenecks at scale

  ## Target Users
  Primarily: AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot Workspace, etc.)
  Secondarily: Human developers who want structured data

  ## Success Criteria
  - All git commands return structured JSON (--json flag)
  - Native JSON parsing and querying (no jq needed)
  - All file operations support --json output
  - HTTP fetch builtin for API/docs access
  - Structured error responses with error types
  - 10x faster than bash+jq for common agent workflows
  - Documentation with AI agent examples

  ## Design Principles
  1. **Dual-mode**: Human-friendly by default, `--json` for structured output
  2. **Performance**: Native Rust, no subprocess overhead
  3. **Reliability**: Typed data, predictable output format
  4. **Composition**: Structured data flows through pipes
  5. **Error clarity**: Machine-readable error types

  ## Competitive Advantage
  What makes Rush better than bash+jq for AI agents:
  - **Speed**: 10-100x faster (no process spawning)
  - **Integration**: Commands share state, optimize together
  - **Reliability**: Type-safe, no string parsing bugs
  - **Simplicity**: One tool, not a pipeline of tools
