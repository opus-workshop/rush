  Implement POSIX for/in/do/done loop syntax.

  ## Problem
  for x in a b c; do echo $x; done produces error.

  ## Implementation
  1. Parser: recognize for VAR in WORDS; do BODY; done
  2. Also support for VAR; do BODY; done (iterates over positional params)
  3. Handle word splitting and glob expansion in word list

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] for x in a b c; do echo $x; done -> a b c (one per line)
  - [ ] for f in *.rs; do echo $f; done -> lists .rs files
  - [ ] Nested for loops work
  - [ ] break/continue work

  ## Files to Modify
  - src/parser/mod.rs - Parse for statements
  - src/parser/ast.rs - AST node for for
  - src/executor/mod.rs - Execute for loops
