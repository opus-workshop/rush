  As a shell scripter, I need true and false builtins so I can write conditionals and infinite loops.

  ## Priority: P0 - CRITICAL
  Essential for any conditional logic or loops.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] `true` always exits with code 0
  - [ ] `false` always exits with code 1
  - [ ] Work in conditionals: `if true; then echo yes; fi`
  - [ ] Work in loops: `while true; do echo loop; sleep 1; done`
  - [ ] Work with && and ||: `true && echo yes`, `false || echo no`
  - [ ] Ignore all arguments (POSIX behavior)
  - [ ] cargo test passes
  - [ ] cargo build --release succeeds
  - [ ] cargo clippy -- -D warnings passes

  ## Use Cases
  ```bash
  # Infinite loop
  while true; do
    echo "Running..."
    sleep 1
  done

  # Conditionals
  if true; then
    echo "This always runs"
  fi

  # Logic
  true && echo "Success" || echo "Failure"
  false && echo "Won't print" || echo "Will print"
  ```

  ## Technical Implementation
  - Add to src/builtins/mod.rs as simple functions
  - `builtin_true` returns ExecutionResult with exit_code 0
  - `builtin_false` returns ExecutionResult with exit_code 1
  - No stdout/stderr output

  ## Testing
  - Exit codes
  - Use in conditionals
  - Use in loops
  - With && and ||

  ## Estimated Effort: 1 hour
labels:
- builtin
- critical
- p0
- scripting
