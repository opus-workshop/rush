description: |-
  Add comparison mode that benchmarks Rush against bash and zsh.

  ## Scope
  - rush --benchmark compare runs same operations in Rush, bash, zsh
  - Side-by-side timing comparison table
  - Speedup ratios (e.g. 225x faster)
  - Hyperfine integration for statistical rigor
  - Warmup runs to eliminate cold-start bias

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] rush --benchmark compare shows Rush vs bash vs zsh
  - [ ] Includes speedup ratios
  - [ ] Statistical confidence (std dev, min/max)
  - [ ] Fair comparison (same data, same operations)

  ## Files
  - src/benchmark/compare.rs (new)
  - src/benchmark/mod.rs (register)
labels:
- benchmark
