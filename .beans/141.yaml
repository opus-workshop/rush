  ## Problem
  The Rust default allocator (system malloc wrapper) adds measurable overhead vs bash's decades-optimized glibc malloc. Research shows 1-3ms of Rust startup is allocator and runtime overhead.

  ## Evidence from Bash Research
  - Bash uses glibc's malloc directly, highly optimized for decades
  - Rust's std allocator wraps system malloc with additional safety checks
  - mimalloc (Microsoft) and jemalloc are proven faster for CLI startup patterns
  - Fish shell uses mimalloc for similar reasons

  ## Implementation (2 lines of code)
  Add to Cargo.toml:
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  mimalloc = { version = "0.1", default-features = false }
  ```

  Add to src/main.rs (or lib.rs):
  ```rust
  #[global_allocator]
  static GLOBAL: mimalloc::MiMalloc = mimalloc::MiMalloc;
  ```

  ## Why mimalloc
  - ~7% faster for CLI workloads vs system allocator
  - Lower memory fragmentation
  - Better cache locality for small allocations (like HashMap entries, String buffers)
  - Used by: Bun, Fish shell, various Rust CLIs

  ## Also add to Cargo.toml release profile
  ```toml
  [profile.release]
  panic = "abort"  # Eliminates unwinding tables, saves ~200KB binary size
  ```

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] mimalloc added as global allocator
  - [ ] panic = "abort" set in release profile
  - [ ] cargo build --release succeeds
  - [ ] cargo test passes
  - [ ] Startup time measurably improved (hyperfine before/after)
  - [ ] Binary size same or smaller
labels:
- performance
- quick-win
- startup
