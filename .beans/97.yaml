  Re-enable the `kill` builtin for sending signals to processes.

  ## Context
  The `kill` builtin exists at `src/builtins/kill.rs` but is commented out. Essential for process management and job control.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - Uncomment `kill` module in src/builtins/mod.rs
  - Uncomment kill builtin registration
  - Test basic kill: `kill PID` (sends SIGTERM)
  - Test specific signal: `kill -9 PID`, `kill -KILL PID`
  - Test signal names: `kill -INT PID`, `kill -TERM PID`
  - Test signal numbers: `kill -2 PID`, `kill -15 PID`
  - Test job specs: `kill %1`, `kill %+`, `kill %-`
  - Test kill -l (list available signals)
  - Test error handling (invalid PID, permission denied)
  - Add integration tests
  - Update help text

  ## POSIX Requirements
  - Send signal to process(es)
  - Default signal is TERM (15)
  - Accept signal by name (-TERM) or number (-15)
  - Accept job specifications (%1, %+, etc.)
  - `kill -l` lists signal names
  - Exit code 0 on success, >0 on error

  ## Files to Modify
  - src/builtins/mod.rs (uncomment)
  - src/builtins/kill.rs (verify implementation)
  - src/jobs/mod.rs (verify job spec integration)
  - tests/signal_tests.rs or similar (add tests)

  ## Estimated Effort
  35-45k tokens (re-enable, test signals, add tests)
verify: cargo build --release && cargo test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings
labels:
- builtin
- critical
- posix
