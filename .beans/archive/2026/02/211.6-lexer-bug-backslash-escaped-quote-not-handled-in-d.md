  ## Problem
  The escape sequence \" inside double-quoted strings does not work.

  ## Reproduction
  rush -c 'echo "quote: \"test\""'
  Expected: quote: "test"
  Actual: quote: \"test\  (truncated, literal backslash shown)

  ## Expected
  \" should produce a literal quote character inside double-quoted strings.
