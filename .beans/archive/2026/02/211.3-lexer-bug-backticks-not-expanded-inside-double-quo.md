  ## Problem
  Legacy command substitution with backticks does not expand inside double-quoted strings.

  ## Reproduction
  - rush -c 'echo "Year: `date +%Y`"' - Prints literal backticks
  - rush -c 'echo `date +%Y`' - Works (unquoted)

  ## Expected
  Backticks should expand inside double-quoted strings.
