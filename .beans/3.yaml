  Make Rush stable enough to be used as a default login shell on macOS/Linux.

  ## Success Criteria
  - ✅ All tests pass (including new stability tests)
  - ✅ Can source standard shell configs (~/.profile, ~/.rushrc equivalents)
  - ✅ Can run common system scripts without errors
  - ✅ Handles signals gracefully (no orphaned processes)
  - ✅ Works in both TTY and non-TTY modes
  - ✅ Exit codes propagate correctly
  - ✅ No crashes during normal operation
  - ✅ Can survive and recover from parse errors
  - ✅ Job control works (background jobs don't block)
  - ✅ Used successfully as login shell for 1 week without issues

  ## Timeline
  3-4 weeks to production-ready:
  - Week 1: Critical blockers (non-TTY, signals, redirection, subshells, exit codes)
  - Week 2: Core features (variable expansion, wildcards, command substitution)
  - Week 3: Job control and polish
  - Week 4: Stability testing and integration tests
