  Show per-stage timing for pipelines.

  ## Scope
  - time cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 shows time per stage
  - Distinguish builtin vs external per stage
  - Show pipeline overhead separately
  - Clean tabular output

  ## Example Output
  time find . -name '*.rs' | grep pub | wc -l
    find:      0.9ms (builtin)
    grep:      0.4ms (builtin)
    wc:        0.1ms (builtin)
    pipeline:  0.2ms (overhead)
    total:     1.6ms

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Multi-stage pipelines show per-stage times
  - [ ] Builtin vs external labeled
  - [ ] Overhead shown separately

  ## Files
  - src/builtins/time.rs (extend)
  - src/executor/pipeline.rs (add stage timing hooks)
