  As a user learning Rush, I want command suggestions when I mistype so that I can discover the correct command.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Typo detection for commands: "carg" → "cargo"
  - [ ] Suggests from command history
  - [ ] Suggests based on current context (git repo → git commands)
  - [ ] Configurable threshold for suggestions
  - [ ] Shows multiple suggestions if close match
  - [ ] Works for both builtins and external commands
  - [ ] cargo test passes (all tests including suggestion tests)
  - [ ] cargo build --release succeeds
  - [ ] cargo clippy -- -D warnings passes
  - [ ] Manual testing: verify context-aware suggestions

  ## Technical Notes
  - Reuse fuzzy matcher from Story 6 or history module
  - Build command suggestion index
  - Integrate with error handling
  - Add configuration option to disable
