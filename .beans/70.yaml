  Re-enable the commented-out `read` builtin and ensure it works correctly with full POSIX semantics.

  ## Context
  The `read` builtin exists at `src/builtins/read.rs` but is commented out in `src/builtins/mod.rs`. It needs to be uncommented, tested, and verified.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - Uncomment `read` module in src/builtins/mod.rs
  - Uncomment read builtin registration
  - Test basic read functionality: `read VAR`
  - Test reading multiple variables: `read VAR1 VAR2 VAR3`
  - Test reading from stdin in pipelines: `echo "hello" | read VAR`
  - Test IFS-based word splitting (if IFS is available, else note limitation)
  - Test -r flag (disable backslash escapes)
  - Test -p flag (prompt)
  - Add integration tests
  - Update help text

  ## POSIX Requirements
  - Read one line from stdin
  - Split into words based on IFS
  - Assign words to variables (first word → first var, etc.)
  - Last variable gets all remaining words
  - Exit code 0 on success, non-zero on EOF

  ## Files to Modify
  - src/builtins/mod.rs (uncomment)
  - src/builtins/read.rs (verify/fix implementation)
  - tests/builtin_tests.rs or similar (add tests)

  ## Estimated Effort
  30-40k tokens (re-enable, fix issues, add tests)
labels:
- builtin
- critical
- posix
