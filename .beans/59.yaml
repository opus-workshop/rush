  Current .gitignore is too permissive, allowing backup files, agent artifacts, and test scripts to accumulate.

  Add rules for:
  - Backup files: *.bak, *.bak[0-9], *.tmp, *.rej, *.fix, *.duperr, *.final, *.final[0-9]
  - Agent tooling: .ralph-tui/
  - Stray patches: *.patch (keep specific ones via !name.patch if needed)
  - Root test scripts: /test_*.sh, /test_*.rush
  - Agent status artifacts: /BEAD_*.md, /*_STATUS.md, /*_SUMMARY.md, /*_IMPLEMENTATION.md, /*_VERIFICATION.md

  Do NOT gitignore .beads/ (that is intentionally tracked for issue management).

  Acceptance criteria:
  - git status no longer shows backup/temp files as untracked
  - Future .bak/.tmp files are automatically ignored
  - .beads/ directory remains tracked
