  Implement the `continue` builtin for skipping to next loop iteration.

  ## Context
  Currently missing. Essential for loop control flow.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - Create src/builtins/continue.rs
  - Implement continue builtin
  - Register in src/builtins/mod.rs
  - Test basic continue: skips to next iteration of innermost loop
  - Test continue N: skips N levels of nested loops
  - Test continue outside loop (should error)
  - Test continue with invalid N (should error)
  - Define ContinueSignal similar to ReturnSignal/BreakSignal
  - Ensure executor catches ContinueSignal
  - Add integration tests
  - Update help text

  ## POSIX Requirements
  - Skip to next iteration of for, while, or until loop
  - `continue [n]` affects n enclosing loops (default 1)
  - Error if n > number of enclosing loops
  - Error if called outside loop
  - Exit code 0 on success, >0 on error

  ## Files to Create/Modify
  - src/builtins/continue.rs (new file)
  - src/builtins/mod.rs (register builtin, export ContinueSignal if needed)
  - src/executor/mod.rs (handle ContinueSignal in loops)
  - tests/loop_control_tests.rs (add tests)

  ## Estimated Effort
  40-50k tokens (implement from scratch, add signal handling, add tests)

  Continue builtin was already fully implemented. Verified:
  - ContinueSignal struct in src/builtins/continue_builtin.rs
  - builtin_continue function handles loop context validation and n-level continue
  - Registered as 'continue' in BUILTIN_MAP in src/builtins/mod.rs
  - Executor handles ContinueSignal in for/while/until loops (src/executor/mod.rs)
  - All 7 unit tests pass
  - 814 library tests pass
  - Release build succeeds
  - Functional testing confirms: basic continue, continue outside loop error, continue n levels
labels:
- builtin
- control-flow
- critical
- loops
- posix
