  As a shell user, I want standard Unix redirections (>, >>, 2>, &>) so that I can redirect output to files like any Unix shell.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] stdout redirection: `echo "test" > file.txt`
  - [ ] Append mode: `echo "more" >> file.txt`
  - [ ] stderr redirection: `command 2> errors.log`
  - [ ] Combined redirection: `command &> output.log`
  - [ ] Input redirection: `command < input.txt`
  - [ ] Works with pipes: `cmd | grep foo > results.txt`
  - [ ] cargo test passes (all tests including new redirection tests)
  - [ ] cargo build --release succeeds
  - [ ] cargo clippy -- -D warnings passes
  - [ ] Manual testing: verify files created with correct content

  ## Technical Notes
  - Extend src/executor/pipeline.rs
  - Parse redirection operators in lexer/parser
  - Handle file creation/appending
  - Properly separate stdout/stderr streams

- '1.0'
