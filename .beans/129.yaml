  - Categories: variables, control flow, builtins, syntax, expansions

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] 50+ bash features catalogued
  - [ ] Each has support status
  - [ ] Workarounds documented for unsupported
  - [ ] Easy to update as Rush adds features

  ## Files

  - src/compat/features.rs (feature definitions)
