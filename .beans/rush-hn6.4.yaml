  Add fuzzy matching and description support to completion system.

  ## What to implement
  - FuzzyMatcher for prefix-agnostic matching
  - Description formatting and alignment
  - Filtering based on partial input
  - Performance optimization for large result sets

  ## Files to Modify
  - src/completion/engine.rs (add fuzzy matching logic)
  - src/completion/formatter.rs or inline helpers (description formatting)

  ## Example Behavior
  ```
  ls -<TAB>l             → -l, --long (fuzzy matches 'l' to 'long')
  find -<TAB>m           → -maxdepth, -mkdir (fuzzy matches 'm')
  ```
acceptance: |-
  - Fuzzy matching works for partial input (not just prefix)
  - Descriptions aligned and readable
  - Large completion sets (100+ items) still fast
  - Works with all completion providers
  - Descriptions sourced from help metadata
  - cargo test passes
