  Implement POSIX until loop syntax and execution.

  ## Context
  The until loop is the inverse of while. Executes until condition is true.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - Add until parsing to parser
  - Add Until node to AST
  - Implement until execution in executor
  - Test basic until: `i=0; until [ $i -ge 5 ]; do echo $i; i=$((i+1)); done`
  - Test until with break
  - Test until with continue
  - Test nested until loops
  - Test until mixed with while loops
  - Test exit code propagation
  - Add integration tests
  - Document syntax

  ## POSIX Requirements
  - `until list1; do list2; done`
  - Executes list2 repeatedly as long as list1 exits with non-zero
  - Exit code is last command executed in list2, or 0 if never executed
  - break/continue affect until loops

  ## Files to Create/Modify
  - src/parser.rs (add until parsing)
  - src/ast.rs (add Until node)
  - src/executor/mod.rs (add until execution, handle BreakSignal/ContinueSignal)
  - tests/until_loop_tests.rs (add tests)

  ## Estimated Effort
  40-50k tokens (similar to while, implement parsing, execution, add tests)
labels:
- control-flow
- critical
- loops
- parser
- posix
