  As a shell user, I need glob patterns to work so that I can match multiple files with wildcards.

  ## Priority: P1 - HIGH
  Basic shell functionality.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] `*` matches any characters
  - [ ] `?` matches single character
  - [ ] `[...]` character classes work
  - [ ] `**` recursive glob (bonus)
  - [ ] Dotfiles not matched by default
  - [ ] Empty glob returns error (not literal)
  - [ ] Works with multiple patterns
  - [ ] cargo test passes (all tests including glob tests)
  - [ ] cargo build --release succeeds
  - [ ] cargo clippy -- -D warnings passes

  ## Technical Implementation
  ```rust
  use glob::glob;

  fn expand_globs(pattern: &str) -> Result<Vec<PathBuf>> {
      let matches = glob(pattern)?
          .filter_map(Result::ok)
          .collect();
      Ok(matches)
  }
  ```

  ## Files to Modify
  - src/executor/mod.rs - Expand globs before execution
  - Cargo.toml - Add glob crate

  ## Testing
  - Test * expansion
  - Test ? expansion
  - Test [...] expansion
  - Test dotfile handling
  - Test no matches error

  ## Estimated Effort: 1 day
labels:
- globbing
- p1
- rush
- stability
verify: 'cargo build --release && cargo test && echo "echo test" | ./target/release/rush'
