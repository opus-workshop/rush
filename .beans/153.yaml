  Fix execution of commands with absolute paths like `/bin/true` and `/bin/false`.

  ## Problem
  Absolute path commands fail with "Command not found":
  ```bash
  /bin/true; echo $?
  # Error: Command not found: '/bin/true'

  /bin/false; echo $?
  # Error: Command not found: '/bin/false'
  ```

  ## Expected Behavior
  - `/bin/true` runs successfully (exit 0)
  - `/bin/false` fails (exit 1)
  - Any absolute path command is executed directly
  - No PATH search needed for absolute paths

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] `/bin/true` runs and exits 0
  - [ ] `/bin/false` runs and exits 1
  - [ ] `/bin/echo hello` outputs `hello`
  - [ ] `/usr/bin/env` works
  - [ ] Relative paths like `./script.sh` work
  - [ ] Smoke test: exit code tests pass

  ## Technical Notes
  - Check if command path is absolute (starts with /)
  - If absolute, check if file exists and is executable
  - If not absolute, search PATH
  - Use std::fs::metadata to check executability

- executor
- foundation
