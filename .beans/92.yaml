  Set up and run POSIX shell test suite to validate compliance.

  ## Context
  After implementing all POSIX features, validate with official test suite or comprehensive script tests.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - Research available POSIX shell test suites (bash test suite, dash tests, etc.)
  - Set up chosen test suite to run against rush
  - Run test suite and document results
  - Categorize failures (critical vs nice-to-have)
  - Fix critical failures
  - Document known limitations/non-POSIX extensions
  - Achieve 90%+ pass rate on core POSIX features
  - Add regression tests for fixed bugs
  - Create compliance report

  ## Test Areas
  - Builtin commands (all required POSIX builtins)
  - Control flow (if, while, until, case, for)
  - Positional parameters and special variables
  - I/O redirection (all forms)
  - Pipelines and command lists
  - Quoting and escaping
  - Job control
  - Signal handling
  - Variable expansion
  - Here-documents
  - Functions

  ## Deliverables
  - Test suite setup documentation
  - Test results report
  - Compliance percentage
  - Known issues list
  - Regression test additions

  ## Estimated Effort
  55-60k tokens (setup tests, run, analyze, fix issues, document)
labels:
- compliance
- posix
- testing
- validation
verify: test -d docs
