  Implement time builtin that shows execution time.

  ## Scope
  - time command shows real/user/sys like POSIX
  - Works with simple commands and pipelines
  - Builtin registered and callable
  - Handles external commands and builtins

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] time echo hello shows timing
  - [ ] time sleep 0.1 shows ~100ms
  - [ ] Works with pipelines: time ls | wc
  - [ ] cargo test passes

  ## Files
  - src/builtins/time.rs (new)
  - src/builtins/mod.rs (register)
verify: 'cargo build --release && cargo test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && ./tests/smoke_test.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "Smoke tests not available"'
