  Implement full POSIX job specification parsing (%1, %+, %-, %?string, %%).

  ## Context
  Runtime has basic job support but not full job spec parsing. Need complete implementation.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - Parse %1, %2, etc. (job by number)
  - Parse %+ or %% (current job)
  - Parse %- (previous job)
  - Parse %?string (job containing 'string' in command)
  - Parse %string (job starting with 'string')
  - Test kill %1, fg %+, bg %-
  - Test ambiguous matches error gracefully
  - Test invalid job specs error with helpful message
  - Update fg, bg, kill, wait to accept job specs
  - Add integration tests
  - Document job specs

  ## POSIX Requirements
  - %n: job number n
  - %+, %%: current job
  - %-: previous job
  - %?string: job containing string
  - %string: job starting with string
  - Error if job spec doesn't match or is ambiguous

  ## Files to Modify
  - src/jobs/mod.rs (add parse_job_spec function)
  - src/builtins/jobs.rs (use job specs in fg, bg)
  - src/builtins/kill.rs (use job specs)
  - src/builtins/wait.rs (use job specs)
  - tests/job_spec_tests.rs (add tests)

  ## Estimated Effort
  45-55k tokens (implement parsing, update builtins, add tests)
labels:
- important
- job-control
- posix
