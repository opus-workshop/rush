  Extend sed builtin with advanced features.

  ## Scope
  - Address ranges (addr1,addr2)
  - Hold space (h, H, g, G, x commands)
  - Branch and label (b, t, :label)
  - Multi-command with -e or semicolons
  - Append/insert/change (a, i, c commands)
  - Read/write files (r, w commands)
  - Transliterate (y command)

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] sed '2,5d' file -> deletes lines 2-5
  - [ ] sed -e 's/a/b/' -e 's/c/d/' -> multiple substitutions
  - [ ] Hold space commands work
  - [ ] cargo test passes

  ## Files to Modify
  - src/builtins/sed.rs (extend)
