  As a developer, I want to execute Rush shell scripts from files so that I can automate tasks and run saved scripts.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Can execute .rush files: `rush script.rush`
  - [ ] Shebang support: `#!/usr/bin/env rush`
  - [ ] Script arguments accessible via $1, $2, etc.
  - [ ] Exit codes propagate correctly
  - [ ] Error messages show script name and line number
  - [ ] Scripts can source other scripts
  - [ ] cargo test passes (all tests including new script execution tests)
  - [ ] cargo build --release succeeds
  - [ ] cargo clippy -- -D warnings passes
  - [ ] Manual testing: run sample scripts with various features

  ## Technical Notes
  - Modify src/executor/mod.rs to accept file input
  - Add script argument parsing
  - Implement file reading and execution loop
  - Add line number tracking for errors
labels:
- '1.0'
- backend
- critical
- rush
