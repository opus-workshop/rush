description: "Core completion engine - COMPLETED\n\nArchitecture: CompletionEngine module in src/completion/engine.rs with three methods:\n- complete_commands(prefix, limit) for PATH command completion\n- complete_files(prefix, limit) for file/directory completion  \n- fuzzy_filter(candidates, prefix, limit) for scoring with SkimMatcherV2\n\nPerformance: Caching (5min TTL), fuzzy matching, file scanning optimization, result limiting. Supports commands (builtin+PATH+functions), files, flags, context-aware (git/cargo/npm/rust).\n\nKey: Arc<RwLock> caching, SkimMatcherV2 scoring, Unix permission checks, tilde expansion, gitignore support.\n\nTests: All passing for builtin/command/path/flag/context completion.\n\nCommit: 495bc14"
verify: cargo test --lib builtins
