  Implement essential scripting builtins to make Rush a full-featured shell for scripts, not just interactive use.

  ## Motivation
  Rush needs scripting support to enable:
  - Configuration files (~/.rushrc)
  - Git hooks
  - Build scripts
  - Editor integrations (Helix)
  - Automation and cron jobs

  ## Success Criteria
  - All Tier 1 builtins implemented (read, true/false, return, local, shift)
  - All Tier 2 builtins implemented (trap, printf, eval, exec, unset)
  - All Tier 3 builtins implemented (command, builtin, kill, wait, pushd/popd/dirs)
  - Can run basic shell scripts
  - Can execute ~/.rushrc configuration
  - Integration tests for scripting scenarios
  - Documentation for all new builtins

  ## Philosophy
  POSIX-inspired, not POSIX-compliant:
  - Common patterns work (muscle memory)
  - Modern conveniences (better errors, safety)
  - Skip legacy cruft
  - Make scripting better than bash
