  Fix parsing of bare filenames with dots when used as arguments.

  ## Problem
  Bare filename with dot fails to parse:
  ```bash
  cat README.md; echo done
  # Error: rush: Expected command name
  ```

  ## Expected Behavior
  - `cat README.md` parses as command `cat` with argument `README.md`
  - Multiple dots: `tar -xvf archive.tar.gz`
  - Dots in any filename position work
  - No quotes needed

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] `cat README.md; echo done` outputs file contents then `done`
  - [ ] `ls Cargo.toml` works
  - [ ] `cat file.tar.gz` works
  - [ ] `echo test.txt` outputs `test.txt`
  - [ ] Smoke test: bare filename with dot passes

  ## Technical Notes
  - The lexer already handles dots in filenames (from previous fix)
  - This might be an executor/parser issue with how arguments are resolved
  - Check if the command name resolution is consuming the dot incorrectly
